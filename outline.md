# An Oriole for Inner Source
45 min

# Abstract
Inner source is the application of open source methodologies to internally-developed software.
While simple to define, inner source can be difficult to explain and implement successfully.
This presentation introduces the key terms, concepts, and principles for effective inner sourcing along with explanations and real examples.
It is content that is accessible to newcomers while at the same time refreshing to those with experience.
The same information in this presentation is also delivered as an O’Reilly Oriole, available freely at https://www.safaribooksonline.com/oriole/.
We’ll review the Oriole, how to use it, and other Orioles related to inner source that are on the way.

# Background
There are many individuals that are excited about inner source.
They share their experience in [the InnerSource Commons](http://innersourcecommons.org/) and other public locations.
In my experience it's been reasonably difficult to share things that are directly usable by other inner source practitioners.

# Goals
The goal of this presentation is to begin to set guildines, structure, and vocabulary for the industry conversation around inner source.
We'll present common terms that all can use when describing inner source.
Having this common vocabulary is a tangible first step to speaking, working, and building things that all inner source practitioners can use.

We'll also present the opportunity to work on building the further learning paths funded by PayPal.
After this presentation, the attendees should understand:

* the key terms and principles shared in the learning path.
* how to view the learning path videos.
* how to express interest in working on any future segments in the learning path.

# Audience
This presentation will be given at [the ISC Spring Summit](http://paypal.github.io/InnerSourceCommons/events/isc-spring-2018-agenda/).
It is intended for anyone interested in inner source whether novice or expert.

# Outline

## Point out the need for training to exist

shared vocabulary
Centralized location of the material

## Present the principles of good training

we've tried hard to propose things that are modular and fundamental
we need modular training (just like modular projects)
What is the purpose of the learning path?
content delivered two ways: video and text

## Share the actual training that is available

What is the purpose of the learning path?
not really an Oriole
what is a learning path
the videos can be distributed on YouTube as well
an outline of what is in the learning path
they key terms and principles in the learning path
we should use the key terms and principles when talking in the industry and talking to each other
clear articulation of the basic components of inner source vs how to be successful at doing it
what are the common points that all implemenatations of inner source share
what are the minimum points necessary for this thing to actually be inner source (vs. something that just looks like inner source?
Is there a way that we can split of everything that is necessary and common?

## Share how to get involved in making more training

how to make a learning path segment:

* outline
* article
* talk
* comprehension questions

what the experience of making these learning path segments was actually like
there is professional help (from O'Reilly) in filiming and editing the videos
show a little clip of one of the learning path segments
summary of what we've learned
