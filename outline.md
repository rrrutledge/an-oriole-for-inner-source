# An Oriole for Inner Source
45 min

## Abstract

_Note: This abstract was created in February 2018 for submission of this talk to [the ISC Spring Summit](http://paypal.github.io/InnerSourceCommons/events/isc-spring-2018-agenda/) and is already posted there_.

Inner source is the application of open source methodologies to internally-developed software.
While simple to define, inner source can be difficult to explain and implement successfully.
This presentation introduces the key terms, concepts, and principles for effective inner sourcing along with explanations and real examples.
It is content that is accessible to newcomers while at the same time refreshing to those with experience.
The same information in this presentation is also delivered as an O’Reilly Oriole, available freely at https://www.safaribooksonline.com/oriole/.
We’ll review the Oriole, how to use it, and other Orioles related to inner source that are on the way.

## Background
Many individuals that are excited about inner source share their experience in [the InnerSource Commons](http://innersourcecommons.org/) and other public locations.
In my experience it's been reasonably difficult for inner source practitioners to share ideas and guidance that are directly usable by others.

## Goals
The goal of this presentation is to share guidelines, structure, and vocabulary for the public conversation around inner source.
We'll present common terms that all can use when describing inner source.
Having this common vocabulary is a tangible first step to speaking, working, and building things that all inner source practitioners can use.

We'll also present the opportunity to work on building the further learning paths funded by PayPal.
After this presentation, the attendees should understand:

* the key terms and principles shared in the learning path.
* how to view the learning path videos.
* how to express interest in working on any future segments in the learning path.

## Audience
This presentation will be given at [the ISC Spring Summit](http://paypal.github.io/InnerSourceCommons/events/isc-spring-2018-agenda/).
It is intended for anyone interested in inner source whether novice or expert.

## Outline

### Introduction

* It's been a fantastic conference.
* I'm excited for others not in this room to get the same learning.
* There's not a one-stop, public location for concrete, approachable, and actionable information on inner source.
* Inner source is becoming a buzz word.  Need to get ahead of the brand dilution.
* PayPal (with Danese coordinating) is funding a publically-accessible set of professionally-produced trainings - an O'Reilly learning path.

## Learning Path

* The abstract said this was an Oriole.  It's actually a Learning Path.  Both have text and video components.
* Modules of information about inner source.
* Modules are independently consumable or as a group.
* No assumption of how the content of the modules will be applied or extended.
* Content consumable via video _or_ text.

## The Current Content

* Presents inner source as two teams with one dependent on the other.
* Inner source comes into play when the dependent team can't get a requested feature.
* We review the drawbacks of wait it out, work around, and escalate.
* An inner source contribution is defined in terms of:
  * **Host** and **guest** teams
  * A **contributor** submitting code.  A **trusted committer** reviewing the fitness code and mentoring the contributor.  And a **product owner** reviewing the desirability of the requested feature.
* The benefits of inner source are listed as:
  * A company-scalable way for guests to get in their features.
  * Expanded engineering ability for hosts with high demand for features.
  * Improved requirements and prioritization and alignment
  * Break down company engineering silos
* Specific shapes and setup of inner source may vary.  For that reason the training also lays down core, unvarying principles that all implementations of inner source should follow to be successful in producing those benefits and solving that problem.
  * Voluntary code contribution.  On the part of the guests and hosts.
  * Prioritized mentorship.  From the host to the guest.
  
## How to Access

* The learning path will be available in _Safari_.  Everyone here gets a free _Safari_ membership.
* We are still in post-production on the specific learning path.  Leave your favorite emoji on my recent post in the _innersourcecommons_ _Slack_ and I will email you when the content is finished.
* We are also making the videos and text freely-available outside of _Safari_.

## What's next

* There is more training coming.  The same modular, multi-media approach to habits and patterns for success as a contributor, trusted committer, and product owner involved with inner source.
* There is opportunity to get involved in the production of those future modules.  Lots of ways to be involved:
  * Speaker (speaking evaluator).  Do the speaking content.  Probably about 20 hours of time.  (2 hours as a review)
  * Writer (copy reviewer).  Produce the written content.  Probably about 40 hours of time.  (4 hours as a review)
  * Post-production (also reviewer).  Makin' slides, etc.  Probably about 10 hours of time.  (1 hour as a review)
* Share my own experience on being involved in the process.

## Call to action

* Watch and read the content.
* Share it with others.
* Use the terms in your conversation with others.  Doing so should result in conversations and writing that we can all understand more-quick and share and apply more-broadly.
* Reach out with interest in working on future Learning Path segments.
